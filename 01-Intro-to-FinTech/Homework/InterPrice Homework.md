## Overview and Origin

* InterPrice Technologies, founded 2020 by by Olga Chin (Current CEO)

* Olga worked in Capital Markets team helping corporations issue debt to finance their operations, and learned about the serious lack of transparency on that side of the business. She left her job at MUFG syndicating deals to start InterPrice in 2019, and never looked back.   

* The company has received 1 round of funding, announced on March 8, 2021, for the amount of 2.5MM USD. 4 Venture Capital Firms headline their seed funding: Operator Partners, Browery Capital, Dash Fund, and Chaos Ventures. This was a Class A funding.


## Business Activities:

* The efficient financing ones business is fundamental to the success of any firm. Financing is accomplished through many different channels using many different kinds of debt that are traded and valued differently across many exchanges. Quotations are always changing, meaning that a firms cost of financing is equally as dynamic. InterPrice is a way to simplify the process, and allows for a clearer look into a firms true cost of capital. InterPrice provides a platform that aggregates indications and displays real time and historical borrowing costs. The result is a clear picture into a firms financing, and gives business owners the confidence to make accurate and informed financing decisions while saving time and many, many basis points. 

* InterPrice's customers include financing entities (sell side) and those seeking financing, the buy side. Specifically, and most importantly, they are searching for corporate debt issuers in capital markets to integrate  onto their platform. Eventually, the team is hoping to create a sort of subsidiary capital market that uses bank indications on corporate debt to decrease the costs of both sides of the transaction. It will provide an easy platform for corporate debt issuers to sell their debt to firms looking for yield on Cash. This will decrease the cost of funding for the firm raising money, and increase the yield of the cash investment. This has the possibility to massively increase InterPrice's strangle over the Capital Markets world, and an change the layout of the market. 

* They create softwear in hous in a cloud based server that hosts the domain for the product. 


## Landscape:

* As mentioned a few times, the "domain" of the firm is in the Debt Capital Markets space. 

* The Corporate Debt model of raising financing is extremely old, aged, expensive, yet necessary. The market for corporate and government debt easily is in the Trillions in market value, and the way this debt is issued has not changed in many years. Underwriters price the likelihood a firm is to repay an amount of debt, the bond is assigned a credit rating, and then offer directly into a secondary market through the unwriting entity, usually a large bank or financial institution. What InerPrice is looking to solve is the transparency of information using this process. To know what upcoming issuance would cost, one would need to get an indication from a handful of underwriting entities, aggregate those, and hope that by the time they are done comparing the data, interest rate conditions have not changed drastically enough to render those indications worthless. There have been many innovations in the way firms buy and sell these, get quotes for secondary market data, but nothing notable for the Corporations debt issuance. InterPrice will streamline this process, and modernize debt issuance in a way that the Banking world is not completely ready for.

* There are some big names that provide transparency on the accounting side of Corporate treasury, which is an important part of the financing picture (to know just how liquid you are) but not a perfect representation of what it would hypothetically cost a firm to issue short term debt. 


## Results

* InterPrice has seen widespread success onboarding Corporate Treasury clients to their platform. They are seeing that clients mostly appreciate the time they save by not having to wait for indications on debt issuance; rather, they are able to work on more value add projects. This means that the opportunity cost that the InterPrice platform saves massively outweighs it price. In addition, InterPrice is dynamic enough to tailor to the needs of the clients.

* The most important utilization of the InterPrice platform is certainly User Engagement. They have different buckets that they put clients in regarding engagement, ranging from Ver Engaged to Hardly engaged. They measure this engagement through a number of empiracle measures (clicks, refreshes, follow ups, requests to InterPrice tech team) as well as weekly calls with clients, creating a line of communication. 

* Interprice is a disruptor, and has seen some early success. They have paying clients shortly after their first round of funding, and are hoping to raise mor capital soon. Since they have such a unique model, they donâ€™t have any competitors that they can measure up against. Interestingly enough, they are seeing some push back from Ban entities, claiming that their indications are confidential information, and should not be able to be digested into a platform. InterPrice solved this problem through a series of NDAs. In short, they are doing well, and hoping to continue to grow in the space. 


## Recommendations

* The immediate problem that I see with InterPrice is a lack of an ability understand how often their clients are using the platform. They can see how often Data is pulled, but it is difficult to know if the clients are using the platform to finalize funding with the banks on the platform, or if it is just window dressing for the Financial side of the fir, I would suggest they invest in some better data collection technology to understand client engagement better. I believe, also, they should expand the peer - to - peer financing model that they are considering using. This could create a whole sub market that could prove extremely profitable to InterPrice. It would be using Bank data to quote cost of capital, but executing the transactions seperate from those financial institutions. This could disrupt the industry greatly, much for then a visual platform ever could. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
